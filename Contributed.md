  * [Adafruit RGBLCDShield machine](/tinkerspy/Automaton_Adafruit_RGBLCDShield) A complete user interface, the Adafruit LCD shield with 5 buttons split into two state machines. Since the LCD updates relatively slowly the machine is designed to use double buffering to update it while running in the background wich keeps the impact to system performance to a minimum.
